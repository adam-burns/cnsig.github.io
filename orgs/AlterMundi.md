[AlterMundi] is an organization that fosters the rising of a new paradigm founded on  freedom gained through peer collaboration. We explore different  manifestations of these peer-to-peer alternatives and in particular we  do a great deal of work in relation to Wireless Community Networks.

We have developed a WCN model based on low-cost, multi-radio mesh nodes running our [LibreMesh](http://libremesh.org) firmware, which automatically configures the mesh network. Together with a number of organizations from around the world we are currently developing the [LibreRouter](http://librerouter.org), an open hardware project aimed at providing a reliable platform for community networks which is specificaly tailored to their needs.

Several network projects in South America and other regions have already adopted the tools we have developed.

[AlterMundi] is part of the APC network and it also took part in the creation of the [Dynamic Coalition on Community Connectivity](https://www.intgovforum.org/cms/175-igf-2015/3014-dynamic-coalition-on-community-connectivity-dc3) (IGF). Our members are regular speakers in national and international technical and governance events.

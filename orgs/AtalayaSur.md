[Atalaya Sur] is a project which mission is to bring technology to the historically most neglected people of Argentina.

In this way, [Atalaya Sur] acts as a fundamental tool for social inclusion, access to knowledge and  knowledge production.

Nowadays, information and communication technologies (ICT) progress at a frenzied pace, widening the digital gap and exacerbating the structural inequalities already existing in our society

That’s why [Atalaya Sur] concentrates its efforts along three lines of work:
 * Defend people’s right to connectivity for those who are currently excluded or have very limited access to the Internet developing community networks
 * Make the production of content and speeches on the Internet available to everyone.
 *  Encourage technological skills towards IA, programming and telecomunications workshops, improving both labor and education conditions.
